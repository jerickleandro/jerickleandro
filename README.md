# Hello word, I'm Erick ‍💻


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jerickleandro/jerickleandro/master/gh-header-image.jpg" alt="banner that says Erick Leandro - Developer Web and mobile">

First of all, I'm passionate about technology and programming. I've done several things in my life like: caboman, videographer, video editor, pamphleteer, stockist, computer technician, but today I consider that I'm doing what I really love, to develop.
I am currently a web programmer, working with PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, Jquery technologies. I also develop for mobile with Flutter and Java technologies (spring boot) for backend.
I am co-founder of D3 Co. A partnership of three friends who collaborate to develop their personal projects.
